            <h1>About Me</h1>
            Hey, my name is Kenneth Santarosa and I am currently a 3rd year informatics student 
            at the Univeristy of California Irvine. My career goal is to become a full-stack web
            developer in a professional setting. Currently I am a intern at The Portal
            where along with other students, I am helping to develop web applications for real 
            clients.
            I am relatively new to the field, but with the work that I have done outside of school
            I feel confident and qualified to create both static websites and web applications.
            On my spare time, when I am not coding I like to go the movies, play basketball,
            make music and play instruments, and go out with family and friends.

            My first real web develpement work experience took place in Level 2 designs. 
            Level 2 designs is a company in Katella which offers IT solutions and web development.
            My experience at Level 2 designs was working with platforms such as Wordpress and Shopify.
            Often my tasks were to make changes to exsisting code or add completely new sections.
            HTML, CSS, and responsive design were the technologies I learned while working there.

            The Portal is were I am currently working at. The Portal's training program
            taught me how to use javascript front-end libraries like jquery and the use of
            AJAX. We also used node, express, mongoose, and mongoDB for the backend side of training.
            The three weeks of training revolved around recreating the website Trello as practice for both
            front-end and back-end development work. Currently I am on the portal's team helping
            to develop web application using reactjs for clients and company internal projects.

        <p>
          During training at the portal, I was tasked to recreate a smaller scale
          version of the website Trello under the project name Prello. Prello was the
          project that taught me a lot of the fundamental skills as a programmer including
          traversing and manipulating the DOM using javascript, using jquery to make ajax
          calls to our local server, creating session cookies, using socketio, using nodejs, 
          setting up the backend and routing with express, setting up mongodb on our local machines, 
          and setting up the models for mongodb using moongoose.
        </p>
          <h3 id="login" >Login Page <span class="triangle-down"/></h3>
          <div id="login-content" class="project-section hide">
            <div>
              <img src="./images/login.png" alt="login image" class="img-view-icon"/>
              <p>
                The sign forms use <strong>authentication</strong> in order to make sure a user inputs a
                a valid email address, and that both passwords match. Creating an account also
                <strong>decrypt's</strong> the users password in order to make sure backend admins cannot view
                their passwords as well as any potential hackers. The login form checks to see if
                the user exsits and if they do, creates a <strong>sessions cookie</strong> which allows the user
                to use the website. If a user tries to view a page without logging in first,
                the user is <strong>redirected</strong> back to the login page. Finally, the login page has a 
                forgot password icon that lets users change their password if they forgot their 
                password.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <img src="./images/forgot-password.png" alt="forgot password image" class="img-view-icon"/>
              <p>
                A user who may have forgotten their password can use the forgot password link
                to reset their password. The link will send an email to the user with a <strong>temporary 
                website route</strong> that lets the user change thier password. After changing their password
                or clicking forget password again, the temporary route expires.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <img src="./images/reset-password.png" alt="reset password image" class="img-view-icon"/>              
              <p>
                Reset password is a form field which will allow the user to change their password
                for their respective email. Once the form is submitted the page redirects the user
                back to the login screen and removes the reset password link from the database.

          <div id="boards-content" class="project-section hide">
            <div>
              <img src="./images/boards.png" alt="boards image" class="img-view-icon"/>
              <p>
                The boards page can be seen as the dashboard page for the website. The boards page
                is used to keep track of different projects in the shape of "boards" with basically 
                to do lists. In the boards page, a user can add boards, see the boards they own, 
                and access other boards they have been added to.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <img src="./images/boards-shared-with-me.png" alt="boards shared with me image" class="img-view-icon"/>              
              <p>
                Boards can be shared with other users they wish to collaberate with. When a user
                adds another user to their individual board, the other user will then see the 
                board under shared boards. In the database I have a <strong>permissions</strong> field which
                contains all the other boards a user can view. If a user tries to view a board
                they are not invited to, they are redirected back to their dashboard.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <img src="./images/boards-dropdown.png" alt="boards dropdown image" class="img-view-icon"/>              
              <p>
                In the navigation bar, the boards button lets users view all their boards and any
                boards that have been shared with them. The boards button is located on both the
                boards page and the individual boards pages themselves like in the picture. The
                navigation bar was made through <strong>ejs</strong>, an html templeting framework to prevent reusing
                the same code over and over.
              </p>
            </div>
            <span id="boards" class="triangle-down flip-vertical toggle-dropdown"/>            
          </div>
          <h3 id="board">Board Page <span class="triangle-down"/></h3>          
          <div id="board-content" class="project-section hide">
            <div>
              <img src="./images/board.png" alt="board image" class="img-view-icon"/>              
              <p>
                The board page contains an id in the url in order to <strong>route</strong> the specific board
                the user wants to access. In the previouse page, each board button contains an id
                which is then put in the url of the board page. Using the id, the board page
                then renders all the different lists and cards that belong to that board. In the
                board page a user can add a list, change the list title, delete a list, add a card,
                and delete a card. This, along with the cards, was the bulk of the project where
                I had to learn how to be able to <strong>GET, PUSH, DELETE, and PATCH</strong> objects in the database 
                and after retrieving the information, <strong>rendering the objects in html and css</strong>.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <img src="./images/menu.png" alt="menu image" class="img-view-icon"/>
              <p>
                On the right side of the page, the menu button would display a dropwdown
                with options. The only option I implemented in my version of prello was to
                allow users to add other users to their board.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <img src="./images/add-user-to-board.png" alt="add user to board image" class="img-view-icon"/>              
              <p>
                The "add users to board modal" allows users to add other users by email. If
                the email does not exsist the user is promted with an <strong>error message</strong> of the
                user does not exsist or the user is already a part of the board. The user
                who is added will then be able to view the boards that were shared with them.
                At the bottom of the card modal a user is able to delete the card once it is
                finished or no longer needed.
              </p>
            </div>
            <span id="board" class="triangle-down flip-vertical toggle-dropdown"/>            
          </div>
          <h3 id="card">Card Modal <span class="triangle-down"/></h3>
          
          <div id="card-content" class="project-section hide">
            <div>
              <img src="./images/modal-title.png" alt="modal title image" class="img-view-icon"/>              
              <p>
                The card modal lets the user edit the individual cards within the different
                lists they have created. The user can edit the title by clicking on it and
                changing the text. The user can assign members to the card by clicking on the
                + button. The user can also remove members from the members list by hovering
                over a member and clicking them. The description can be edited by clicking on
                the edit button. After they finishing editing the description of the card the
                user can click save to save their new description.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <img src="./images/modal-labels.png" alt="modal labels image" class="img-view-icon"/>
              <p>
                The card modal also contains labels. Labels work similar to memebers as a
                user can add a label to the project by clicking the + sign and then be able
                to remove the label by hovering over the individual label and clicking it.
                The modal also allows users to add a comment to the card.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <img src="./images/modal-comments.png" alt="modal comments image" class="img-view-icon"/>
              <p>
                A card can contain any number of comments. Comments within the card modal
                consist of an author, the comment itself, date, and a delete comment button.
                The comments are displayed in order of the date they were created. The author
                tag shows which user made the comment. Delete comment lets users delete a
                comment from the database.
